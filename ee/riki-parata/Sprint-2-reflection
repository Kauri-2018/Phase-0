What did I do well in this sprint?

I felt I did well in the Udacity tutorials and followed the instuctions 
correctly. The video, followed by an activity and then a quiz ensured that 
I understood what I was learning.

What didn't I do well in this sprint?

I struggled a bit to understand the tidying tree. A similar feeling I had 
when I was learning to use aGithub. It is something I will look beck over. 
Also wondering what the "div" characteristic is. I feel like I should know what it 
is and how to use it.

What can I improve on next sprint?
I want to continue improving the tidyness of my code using correct format so that my code is
easy to read. I also need to improve on time management as I have really been unbalanced this week.
