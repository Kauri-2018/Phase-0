What did I do well through my nine sprints in Phase 0?
I've learnt a lot of things in these 2 months. Initially I wasn't sure about what I'd be learning and was surprised by the scope of it all. I did well on a number of things especially the last sprint project. It was very cathartic to say the least, I've always had a creative side and perhaps that is the path I want to follow as a developer. 

What could I have done to improve through my nine sprints in Phase 0?
Just more practice I think. When the initial excitement weared off I started slacking which I shouldn't have. 

What learnings and habits have I developed that will help me in Bootcamp?
One thing I've learned for sure is that "You shouldn't be ashamed to ask for help" regardless of what you need help for.
