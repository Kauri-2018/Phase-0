# Sprint 5 Reflections

## What did I do well this sprint?
I timeboxed well and pushed through all the different exercises with gusto!  I am also proud of going above and beyond on some of them, and changing the code during the dom-class-changes so that it would be more DRY.  I like solving the problems, but having the solutions be elegant and readable still.

## What didn't I do well this sprint?
I could have focused more on the mindfulness book, ironically.  I read the chapter, but to be honest it was more of a skim.  I understood what he was saying at the beginning and mostly skimmed to see if anything surprised me or had nuance i was not predicting.  there were parts were I dove in, but not much. I think I was just v. excited to get to the next sprint....but I can slow down.

## What can I improve upon next sprint?
Figuring out a good style for writing JS, and spending more time reflecting upon Search Inside Yourself.
