# What did I do well this sprint?
I took my time, and moved through every Udacity lesson even when it felt like stuff I already  knew.  I foudn this to be rewarding, as the different perspective (and more academic perspective) helped me understand the work far more.  I also worked to help other students where I could, in Slack.  This was socially awkard for me at first, and am glad I jumped outta my shell for it.

# What Didn't I do well this sprint?
I'm not sure, to be honest?  It was fairly straightforward, and I went through the lessons with integrity, kindness, and effort.  I had a hard time with the reading, but was up front about my emotions around it and so do not feel bad that I did not enjoy the first chapter (but still took a lot from it!)

# What can I improve upon next sprint?
I am journalling a biiiit too much, maybe.  A large portion of my time on this sprint was just me writing my thoughts down (either in my personal wiki or through these blogs).  I can find a more succinct way of reflecting and sharing, so they are not as much of a time hog.  I also read through an old blog and it had some misspellings and markdown formatting...which was a bit embarassing.  So I can move through my old pages and fix 'em up!
