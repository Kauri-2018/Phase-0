# Sprint 8 Reflection

## What did I do well this sprint?

I feel I approached this challenge in an honest and curious way.  I used a combination of code I'd been reading about--from the grid class in CSS to the code samples in the codepen calculator- and worked hard to really understand them and use them in my own way.  I am also happy with the clarity of my code.  I feel I am getting to a spot where my code is easy to read without being mad verbose.

## What didn't I do well this sprint?

It took me forever to finish the cultural blog.  Once I finished the assignment I kinda felt _done_ and moved to other projects for the rest of the week (including looking ahead into sprint 9).  Once I did this, though, it was hard to get back to the cultural blog as I felt like I already "finished" sprint 8.  

## What can I improve on?

Finishing each stage before moving to the next one, to keep up momentum.  To do the reflective work at the end of a sprint, even if the main "problem" is solved.
