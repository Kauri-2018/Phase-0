# Sprint 4 Reflection

## What did I do well this sprint?
I used my excitement about javascript to just _power_ through this sprint!  I really took to this one.  I was learning a new language, that had familiarity to the python I _kinda_ know, but styled completely different.  I love how interlinked javascript is with HTML and CSS and how the three work together.  Something clicked in the backpart of my brain while moving through these--awareness that I'm 'getting it' even if I don't consciously get it yet.  This felt awesome!

## What could I do better this sprint?

I'm honestly not sure.  I went through the exercises, I took notes on them, I looked up the things I didn't get, and did further study based on the resources in there.  I am proud of how i approached the work this sprint, and so dont' necessarily wanna say it wasn't good enough, and one thing could have been better.  As of right now, I feel the best thing I could do is "keep it up".

## What can I improve for next sprint?

Consistency, and keeping up with this energy.
