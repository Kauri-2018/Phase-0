# Sprint 3 Reflection

## What did I do well this sprint?
I stopped.  I learned when to let the site be okay, _as it is now_, to keep on with my studies.  The imporatnce of the sprint, I realized, was to learn responsive design in general, and frameworks in general.  It was not to make an incredibly polished portfolio site.  My site is rough, but it's generally responsive, and I was ready to move on.

## What didn't I do well this sprint?
Use frameworks.  I had a hard time basing my site off the skeleton framework.  It was useful for the general text formatting, and the container function...but the site was largely made with main.css styling. 

## What can I improve on next sprint?
Better timeboxing, and not getting lost in a "bikeshedding" moment, where all my time is based on inconsequential things.
