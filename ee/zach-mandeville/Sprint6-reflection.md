# Sprint 6 Reflections

## What Did I do well this sprint?
I was learning something entirely new this sprint.  I'd never worked with JS before to this degree, especially creating loops to the degree we were doing.  I feel proud for even getting through, but also that I worked to document the confusions I had so that I could reference them later.  I had tiny epiphanies around how for and while loops could work, and this made the challenge soooo much easier---but then I journaled on them epiphanies, so that I dont' have to struggle through them again.  

## What didn't I do well this sprint?
STYLE.  It TRIPPED me up!  There was a moment where I was stuck _forever_ on a function that looked accurate, and logically checked out, and worked in the console....but I couldn't get it to run properly on my local file.  It turned out it was all because, in a for loop I'd written (i=0; i < maxbomb; i++) instead of (**var** i; i < maxbomb; i++).  One single word caused me 45 minutes of confusion.  I also kept forgetting curly braces, or didn't know when to use them and when not (now, i just use them for _everything_ and it seems to work well).  I am doing okay with learning how JS functions, and how to make the code generally readable, but I can improve by having my style follow the standard style.

## What can I improve on next sprint?
Style, and reading every single character when reviewing buggy code.
