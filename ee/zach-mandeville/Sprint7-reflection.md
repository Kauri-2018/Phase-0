# Sprint 7 Reflections

##What Did I do well this sprint?
I kept my focus, and I kept it serious.  This one was a bit different for me, in that it asked me to timebox 4 hours and then move through as many exercises as I could in the freeCodeCamp course.  I found this a bit difficult at first (because they felt so rote and detached from the world...I much prefer a full project like minesweeper), but I didn't want to just zoom through the lessons.  So I took time with each one, figured out the most elegant as possible way to solve it, and took as many breaks as I needed.  This kept my motivation up through the week.

##What didn't I do well this sprint?
I got really distracted a lot, but this was also do to life stuff.  I just came back to NYC after a heeeeeavy-ass trip to the West coast and found that I needed to decompress a lot, while also needing to do a bunch of practical life stuff so I can actually _go_ to New Zealand.  So I felt my mind racing a lot whenever I'd sit down to code, thinking of everything else I needed to be doing or wanting to be doing.

##What can I improve next sprint?
Self care, mindfulness, and letting myself sink into the right space for coding.  I can improve my focus.
