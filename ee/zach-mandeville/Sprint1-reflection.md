# Sprint 1 Reflections

## What did I do well this sprint?

I feel like I did a good job of slowing down.  Many of the topics in the sprint I was already familiar with, through personal passions and projects.  I recognized that the way I learned the command line or html may not be within the method that EDA teaches.  By slowing down, I was able to pay more attention to the _tone_ in which the subjects were taught, and starting to absorb the culture of EDA with the lessons about HTML or CSS.

## What didn't I do well this sprint.

Time tracking!  I got used to it after a while, but I had to manually add in a couple entries.  I also had a 12 hour session due to me starting a timer and falling asleep.  Harrison said this would happen, and I was like 'Nah, I'll remember to turn them off." and then I did exactly as he said.  So that's a bit embarassing, but school should be humbling!  By the end of the sprint I was getting real diligent with hitting the timer.  Next up is learning how to properly add each bit of time to the `learn web dev` project, but I know I can do it.

## What can I improve on next sprint?

I can establish the ritual and space for EDA within my somewhat chaotic day.  I learned some good time management techniques in this sprint, and so I'd like to establish them in the next sprint.  I see this as meditation prior to starting up a timebox, and working in some of the centering rituals I already do (tarot, yoga) as extensions of my coding work. I'm not sure how that'll be realized, but I'm excited to find out.
