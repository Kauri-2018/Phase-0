What did I do well on this sprint?
- honestly it's kind of hard to say because it was so spread out, what with starting the sprint, going away and taking a long break, then coming back to it...one thing I was pleased about was that I hadn't forgotten as much as I thought I would have, and I kept up my meditation (although not as strictly) while I was on holiday

What didn't I do well this sprint?
- I didn't read the steps for Rebuild Your Site as thoroughly as I should have, so I ended up not exactly following the way I was supposed to

What can I improve on next sprint?
- allocate time better
- READ THE INSTRUCTIONS MORE THOROUGHLY BEFORE STARTING SOMETHING
- add more CSS to my site
