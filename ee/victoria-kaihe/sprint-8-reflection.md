What did I do well this sprint?
- Perservered. I really had trouble getting through this sprint, between trying to get the work done and trying to get my life in order before bootcamp. But I kept pushing and I think I'm about as ready as I'm going to get.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
- I did get distracted a lot this sprint, I got easily frustrated.

What can I improve on next sprint?
- Try not to have a breakdown!
