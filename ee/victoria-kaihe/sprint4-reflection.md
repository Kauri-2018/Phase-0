What did I do well this sprint?
- Troubleshooting. I found the instructions/explanations on FreeCodeCamp decidedly lacking, which made the exercises difficult for me to understand. This meant that I did a lot of my own research to figure out the problems.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
Time - still fighting myself on time management. It's an on-going battle.
Accountability - I haven't been very present this sprint and it feels crap - not connecting regularly with my peers and withdrawing into myself. I've had a rotation of family visiting constantly since January and it's draining me hard. Stg I'm THIS CLOSE to getting a restraining order against my father-in-law.

What can I improve on next sprint?
SHOW. UP.
Ignore distractions.
Put my foot down.
