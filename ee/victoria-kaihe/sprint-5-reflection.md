What did I do well this sprint?
- I managed my time way better during this sprint and really managed to get a good pace on my work.
- I made more effort to be present, and tried to limit the time I spent figuring things out on my own before asking for help.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
- Despite managing my time better, I was still easily distracted. I've taken some extra steps to see if I can mitigate that even further with the next sprint (goodbye social media!)
- I also found myself getting easily frustrated, although not as badly as the previous sprint.

What can I improve on in the next sprint?
- Keep working on reaching out for help when I need it sooner
