What did I do well this sprint?
I feel like I've been staying accountable to my cohort. My time management has slipped a little on the last sprint but it's not too bad.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
I didn't end up spending as much time on campus as I would have liked (life getting in way - yawn).

What can I improve on next sprint?
SMASH IT
