Although I took a break for this sprint I am still able to do some of this sprint assignment
#What I didn't do well in this sprint? 
Generally Minesweeper is the hardest challenge that I encountered

I will try to do more on next sprint while still maintain the speed of doing the assignment as I only have 3 weeks left before bootcamp starts
