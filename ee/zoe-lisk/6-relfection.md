What did I do well this sprint?
I used mindful breathing to remain calm when I couldn't figure out how to start any code. I was careful to take my time and explore what advice Google had to offer, and I tried out a lot of things, allowing myself to try things that didn't work. 

What didn't I do well this sprint? 
I think I got caught up in product over process when I could stand to lose some of my perfectionism around it. 

What can I improve on next sprint? 
I am going to try to focus on process over product.
