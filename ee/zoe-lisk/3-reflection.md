What did I do well this sprint?
I focused on "process over product" and was happy with the amount of time I spent redesigning the website. I focused on remaining calm and not panicking while doing it, which was really helpful. 

What didn't I do well this sprint? 
In spite of my efforts, I often reverted to thinking about the product more than the process!

What can I improve on in my next sprint?
I have a tendency to do big chunks of work at once which leaves me feeling quite tired and discouraged - back to the Pomodoro technique!
