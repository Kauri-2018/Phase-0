What did I do well this sprint?
I got more of a feel for CSS and felt like some of the concepts started to sink in a bit more. For the first week, I was pretty focused and spent a lot of time on the activities, making sure I really got things. 

What didn't I do well this sprint? 
I went away half a week into the sprint and really lost focus. I was unable to attend a check-in due to being away and a wedding I was attending. 

What can I improve on next speint? 
I want to get to a check-in and have better time management.
