 What did I do well this sprint?
 I still can't believe I got the calculator to work. It's very basic - just basic functions but I'm really pleased! 

 What didn't I do well this sprint?
    I really stuggled with my stress levels when I couldn't even get the buttons to press and print to the display. I spent about 8 hours on it and although I eventually got there I wish I had reached out for help. 

 What can I improve on next sprint?
 I hesitate to reach out because I find it hard to formulate a question. By the time I was really frustrated, I had forgotten most of what I had tried. I wish I had taken more time to try each method, asking for help perhaps after one or two tries.
