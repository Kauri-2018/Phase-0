What did I do well this sprint?
I think I paced myself well and managed to really take time to understand the concepts. I did have to look at the solutions for the Eloquent part, but I made sure to work backwards from the solution rather than just copying it, and I found that that worked well in terms of my understanding. 

What didn't I do well this sprint?
The hardest part of JavaScript for me is actually getting started! I just kind of freeze, not knowing how to start writing the code. 

What can I improve on next sprint?
I want to head into campus and start making that part of my routine. I want to reach out if I do get blocked as I know that has been hard for me in the past. Also, to take a few deep breaths when I feel like I don't know what to do in the first instance.
