What did I do well this sprint? 
I worked hard on the exercises and took the time to read them out loud, which really helped with understanding what was being asked. I also worked on managing frustration levels by taking regular breaks and breathing more regularly when things got tough. 

What didn't I do well this sprint?
I would have liked to have joined the check-in but was unfortunately unable to. Sometimes, I found I got discouraged quite quickly - I wish I had read the Search Inside Yourself chapter first!

What can I improve on next sprint? 
Still working on remaining calm and not becoming discouraged so fast!
