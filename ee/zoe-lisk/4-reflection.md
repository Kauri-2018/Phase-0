What did I do well this sprint?
I worked through frustration well by being mindful of how frustrated I was and taking breaks regularly, rather than trying to power through everything in one go. I also took the time to explore concepts I had passed but didn't think I had really understood. 

What didn't I do well this sprint? 
I was frustrated that I didn't get to attend the weekly check-ins this week. 

What can I improve on next sprint? 
I think I still need to work on pacing. I improved this week  but have a tendency to work until I'm really frustrated and then my stress levels soar. Better breaks and more mindfulness would help.
