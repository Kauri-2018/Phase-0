What did I do well through my nine sprints in Phase 0? 
I commited to the work and really concentrated on understanding concepts. I developed a real enthusiasm for coding and web development. I made an effort to try the different meditation / mindfulness activities even thoough they would be easy to skip over. 

What could I have done to improve through my nine sprints in Phase 0?
I could have reached out more on Slack when I needed help and was feeling frustrated. I could have stuck to the early methods I had read about, like the Pomodoro technique but they kind of fell by the wayside. 

What learnings and habits have I developed that will help me in Bootcamp?
For me it's mainly the mindfulness applied to coding itself. Taking my time, taking deep breaths and problem solving in a way that doesn't mean beating myself up if I don't get something the first time.
