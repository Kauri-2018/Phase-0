# Reflection

## What did I do well through my nine sprints in Phase 0?
- Fristly I found I really like coding just like I thought. I'm happy to attend this bootcamp and meet some of these nice cohorts. 
- I found a way to overcome the fear of doing the whole project from scratch by myself. It works like this:
```
if(the project is too hard to finish){
    for(let taskDifficulty = 0; taskDifficulty < max; taskDifficulty++){
        do small attempt(like console.log something);
        findTheAns();
        give positive feedback to yourself();
    }

    function findTheAns() {
        google(things you want to know);
        askTheCohorts();
        return results;
    }
}
```


## What could I have done to improve through my nine sprints in Phase 0?
- I'm too lazy to do the regular meditation. Hope I can do batter.
- I don't have plan, always learn by interest. I may study for one or two entire days but I may also not do any study for one or two days. I wish I can have a regular learning habit.


## What learnings and habits have I developed that will help me in Bootcamp?  
- One important learning was know how to deal with the projects and how to get start rather than sitting and thinking it's impossible.
- Trade difficulties with ease. When I met a difficult concept or don't know how to solve an issue. Just accept it and tell myself it's common situation when learning things. Then don't spend too much time on it. Do something else. I'm lucky that I always come up with new ideas or solutions when I get up next day.
