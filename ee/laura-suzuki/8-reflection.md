this was the most challenging sprint so far. i think i did well managing my frustrations when I hit road blocks. I was proud of the fact that I could come up with solutions without relying too heavily on exterior sources. next sprint i could learn from the experience of feeling intimidated by starting something from scratch; i hope i can more easily see how to break things down into smaller tasks so i dont feel as daunted.
