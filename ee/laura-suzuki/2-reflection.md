In this sprint I feel  that I'm really becoming at home with the command line. I have the basic commands locked in my memory bank now which is a really nice feeling. It took me a couple of tries to clock the indentation formatting assignment. I feel it's one of those things that I'll develop more of an eye for with practice. As I wrote in my check in, I actually find the cultural/reflection blog posts the most time consuming. Feel like I have far too much to say and I definitely donâ€™t have the resources (read: time, energy) to explore all of those thoughts properly in just a short blog post. I think it's because my Masters topic was partially focused on the interplay of technology and mental health in the context of late capitalism so the Google book is triggering all these wells of information in my brain.  Need to push the pause button on that a lil bit and just get it done!
