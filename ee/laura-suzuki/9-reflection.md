What did I do well through my nine sprints in Phase 0?
I think I was good most of the time at being kind to myself when I hit a frustrating part or roadblock.
 What could I have done to improve through my nine sprints in Phase 0?
Because I found that a lot of Phase 0's technical components was revision of things I had already self-taught within a less focused framework, I probably could have pushed myself to do stretch work a little more. However I think the reason I chose not to was because I felt I am going to be getting plenty of stretching during the bootcamp phase and I wanted to maximise the down time available to me between work and phase 0.
 What learnings and habits have I developed that will help me in Bootcamp?
 learning to properly indent code was extremely helpful, as well as becoming comfortable with git and using console.log to problem solve. breaking things down into small tasks was also helpful, and I also enjoyed revisiting code and refining it into more concise language. I thought I would find that tiresome but it was actually really satisfying.
