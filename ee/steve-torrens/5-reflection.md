What did I do well this sprint?
I really enjoyed playing with Javascript and moved through the exercises well. My
previous experience with python is still paying off. I appreciate that this is not going to last
for ever.

I have started to practice meditation which has been a positive experience. I am 
finding many of the concepts in Search Inside Myself challenging. That said I think
I am engaging with Meng in a positive way.  

What didn't I do well this sprint?
I am worried I went too fast through the sprint and has missed some learnings.

What can I improve on next sprint?
Same things as last sprint, concentrate on the learning, not the doing.
