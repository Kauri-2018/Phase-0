What did I do well through my nine sprints in Phase 0?
Things that went well include:

-I managed to learn heaps about Javascript, CSS and HTML
-I put in the effort even when their were a lot of conflicting priorities
-I have a good set of notes and this has helped reinforce my learnings
-I think I challenged myself where possible

What could I have done to improve through my nine sprints in Phase 0?
-I probably could have made more effort to pair up with others from my cohort
-Often I would jump into an exercise where the best approach was to slow down, think and then act (e.g. pseudo code). 
-Time boxing didn’t always work out for me, particularly for sprint 8

What learnings and habits have I developed that will help me in Bootcamp?
-Meditation
-To push myself and Code at the limit of my knowledge
-Keeping the code neat, readable and commented
-Taking notes
