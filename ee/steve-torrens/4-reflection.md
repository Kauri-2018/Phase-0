What did I do well this sprint?
I went through the Code Camp exercises without too much diffuulty. The basic concepts were familar to me as I have done a wee bit of python coding in the past. I also read a chapter of Eloquent Javascript, which was worth while.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
Still struggling with note taking. The main challenge being that I don't always have my notebook to hand when I ams studying. I may have also possibly gone through the Code Camp exercises a bit quickly.

The next couple of sprints are going to be challenging as work is starting to get busy again. So - lots of juggling.

What can I improve on next sprint?
Take things slowly, and more emphasis on learning rather than doing.
