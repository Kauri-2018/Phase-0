What did I do well this sprint?
I was happy with my choice of project for this sprint. It was, for me, challenging and provided good opptunities for learning. I didn’t get quite to where I wanted to go with the project, however, I think I managed to deliver something that was working (mostly). I had some hurdles - overcoming the haze of JS - along the way. I managed to overcome them which I think was a good result. 

What didn't I do well this sprint?
I didn’t use the ‘reach out’ option when I was stuck. I merrily hacked away at my CSS and got something working, however, to be honest I am still confused about CSS inheritance and cascading (and CSS in general).

What can I improve on next sprint?
At boot camp I am going to have to overcome my inhibitions about reaching out and asking for help.
