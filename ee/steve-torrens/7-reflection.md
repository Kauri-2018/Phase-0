What did I do well this sprint?
I thought I did well getting through the code camp challenges. I tried both the beginner and intermediate challenges, and enjoyed the problem solving process. I also learnt a lot about regex expressions and higher order functions. I took reasonable notes for Chapter 3 of Eloquent Javascript.  

I have continued to regularly meditate and it is helping me to get a good nights sleep (a very, very significant bonus).
 
What didn't I do well this sprint?
Timeboxing for the code camp challenges was a failure (that said I think the extra time was probably a worthwhile investment). I did do some psuedocoding for some of the code camp challenges. I did not find this technique useful in some circumstances as the challenge was really about getting one or two lines of Code right.

What can I improve on next sprint?
Again, maybe some more psuedocoding.
