What did I do well this sprint?
I persevered with the minesweeper programme and got through all of the finishing touches. I enjoyed the challenge and managed to learn a bit more JavaScript along the way.

I have been regularly, meditating which has been good. 

What didn't I do well this sprint?
Probably too much just diving in and not a lot of planning or psuedocoding. Beyond formal sit down meditating I haven't really put too much effort into Meng's other techniques.

What can I improve on next sprint?
Maybe some more psuedocoding.
