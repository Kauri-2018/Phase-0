What did I do well this sprint?
I was happy with the end result for my calculator. I commented up all the CSS and JS. After the refactoring exercise I ended up with hopefully readable code. I was also reasonably disciplined about finishing up as I could have spent a lot more time adding features. I really enjoyed the calculator exercise.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
I forgot to create a branch for the refactor exercise. It is possible to move commits from the master to the branch, however, the process looked slightly daunting.

I took a bit longer to complete this sprint. While work was busy I could have squeezed a couple more additional hours out of the week.

I haven't been doing as much mediatation as I would like. The promise I made during the self care exercise sort of fell by the wayside.

What can I improve on next sprint?
More mediatation.
