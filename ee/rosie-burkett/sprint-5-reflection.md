sprint-5-reflection

What did I do well this sprint?
Some good practice with JavaScript and getting to grips with some of the functions. Tried out various techniques to problem solve and taking time to understand how the code works.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
Feel like I haven't retained as much information as I'd like. Spent longer trying to work out pieces of code than the timebox for eloquent.js. Also, the mindful meditation practice has slipped a bit.

What can I improve on next sprint?
Keep exploring resources and tutorials to get a better understanding of functions, arrays and for loops. Reach out to the cohort. Pick up mindful meditation again.
