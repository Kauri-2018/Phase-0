sprint-2-reflections

What did I do well this sprint?
Worked in blocks of time and limiting my time spent on activities, before moving on. 

What didn't I do well this sprint?
Diving deeper into the semantic structure concept, to have a better understanding of how these elements work, what the browser uses them for and how these differe from the divs.

What can I improve on next sprint?
Continue to work on the time management and recognising when I'm getting fixated on details.
