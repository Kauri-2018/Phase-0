 What did I do well this sprint?
 Had an open mind with JavaScript and tried to keep calm/relaxed mind, even when I felt like I wasn't retaining the information.
 
 What didn't I do well this sprint?
 Keeping in touch with team mates to ask for help - first reaction is to try to solve myself or search the web. Need to get better at reaching out to other humans as well.
 
 What can I improve on next sprint?
 Try and get into EDA so that I'm physically with the team.
