sprint-8-reflection

What did I do well this sprint?
Persisted with the calculator and played a lot with what my style of testing is, to make sure my calculations were working and really understand the issue when they weren't.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
Bit of a broken record... making time for mindful meditation. And (related) let the stress get a bit on top of me this week.  

What can I improve on next sprint?
Set in place some habits for nipping stress in the bud quicker.
