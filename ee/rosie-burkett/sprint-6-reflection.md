sprint-6-reflection

What did I do well this sprint?
Took my time working on process over product, including taking up an additional Udacity JavaScript course, as it didn't feel like a lot of the previous course information had sunk in. The Udacity format of video, reading and tests works well with my learning style and I'm glad I took the time to do this. Spend time trying to nut out the Minesweeper streches and have a list of extras I want to keep playing with when time permits.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
Mindfulness meditation has continued to be put on the back burner.

What can I improve on next sprint?
Arrange time to work directly with Phase 0 friends and make and effort to come into EDA to work some days.
