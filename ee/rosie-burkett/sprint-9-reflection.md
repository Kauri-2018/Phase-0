sprint-9 reflection

What did I do well through my nine sprints in Phase 0?
Kept up a regular pace, keeping to my goals of roughly a sprint a week. Making sure that I carved out time to spend on study, family commitments and down time. Felt like a good balance.

What could I have done to improve through my nine sprints in Phase 0?
Reach out in different ways for help, to reduce time spent problem solving solo. Although I also enjoyed time spent solo too. More pair programming perhaps.

What learnings and habits have I developed that will help me in Bootcamp?
Pace myself. Trust the process. Continue to carve out time for family/downtime, to make sure I don't get burnt out.
