What did I do well through my nine sprints in Phase 0?

The thing that I did well for the most part was to stay in-front, this meant that I had time to work on any problems that I found difficult.

 What could I have done to improve through my nine sprints in Phase 0?
 Helped others by better articulating my point and expressing myself in a more clear and concise manner.

 What learnings and habits have I developed that will help me in Boot camp?

 On top of becoming a better user of industry tools like Git and code writing programs like VSCode I learnt that If I am finding it hard to stay focused then I can use tools like a pomodoro clock.
