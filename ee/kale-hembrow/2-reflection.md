 What did I do well this sprint?
	I think that I did well to finish this sprint by wednesday giving myself more time to work through harder problems in the future

 What didn't I do well this sprint?
 	I often find it hard to read through large bodies of text and it took me a few attempts to get through chapter 1 of Search inside Yourself

 What can I improve on next sprint?
 	I hope to be able to make a greater effort to read through Search inside yourself during the next sprint.
