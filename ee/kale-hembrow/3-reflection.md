What did I do well this sprint?

I found the site redesign this week particurly satisfying as it allowed me to 1. prove to myself what I have learnt and 2. show me what else I need to learn in order to become proficient at HTML/CSS

 What didn't I do well this sprint?

The mobile responsive features of the website are lacking as they in some cases do not work.

 What can I improve on next sprint?

 I hope to expand my knowledge of the responsive features in the future.
