What did I do well this sprint?
I thought I did pretty well to get through the JS section of Free code camp without needing to refer to the help section to many times.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
I will need to revist alot of the JS concepts that I went over as I do not believe that I will remember them when I need them


What can I improve on next sprint?

Information retention.
