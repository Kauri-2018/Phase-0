What did I do well this sprint?
    I worked well through the codeacademy lessons and the "Eloquent Javascript" problems.
What didn't I do well this sprint?
    I wasn't consitent with my study time. I also found the last problem in the Eloquent Javasc quite challenging. Even having seen the solution I don't think I understand it completely.
What can I improve on next sprint?
    Work to a timetable or set study time. I think I need to also recap more as I go along.
