What did I do well this sprint?<br>
    I managed my time a bit better and therefore didn't feel like I wasn't keeping up. Even when I talked to people about the problem I went back and tried different things to see if there were other ways to solve certain things.<br>
What didn't I do well this sprint?<br>
    I still need to internailse the basics - I still have to keep referring back to previous sprints and problems.<br>
What can I improve on next sprint?<br>
    I still need to work more consistently. As long as I can get through the material in time I need to focus a bit deeper into certain concepts to understand it well.
