What did I do well this sprint?
    I worked consistently and had better time management than for the last sprint.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
    On a couple of occasions I looked at the hints too quickly when I should have spent more time thinking about the problem.

What can I improve on next sprint?
    I have room to still improve my time management so that I can be more consistent with work. I also need to be a bit more regular with mindfulness and work on other aspects such as improving my typing.
