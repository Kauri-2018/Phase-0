 What did I do well this sprint?
I think I did a lot of problem solving in this assignment, and felt very accomplished when parts of my code would work as I wanted it to. 

 What didn't I do well this sprint?
I could have improved on my time boxing for the additional features for the minesweeper game. I felt I spent too long on some features that I haven't been able to complete, and this took time away from simpler features that I could have added. 

 What can I improve on next sprint?
 Fro the next sprint, I would live to improve on my focus on one piece of the assignment at a time.
