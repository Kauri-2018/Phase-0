 What did I do well this sprint?
I was far better at using toggle in this sprint, and I also managed my time a lot better, by doign certain parts of assignments when it suited me best, ie watching tutorials in the morning and then reading documents and Search Inside Yourself before bed. 

 What didn't I do well this sprint?
I started goign through the tutorial videos quite quickly as I was familiar with some of the information, but slowed down in the end as I still found it to be useful. 

 What can I improve on next sprint?
 Keep up the toggle timing, and be better prepred with non-assignments activites to avoid distratcions.
