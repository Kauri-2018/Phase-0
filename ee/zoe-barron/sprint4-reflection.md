 What did I do well this sprint?
I believe I went over the concepts well in this sprint. 
 What didn't I do well this sprint?
I had put off answering some of the technical blog questions because I didnt feel I could explain them well enough. But I think I realised that I won't be able to explain it perfectly now, but at some point, I can use this as a comparison for how much I've learned, and how well I can explain it in the future. 
 What can I improve on next sprint?
Setting time aside specifically, and making sure there are no distractions will work best for me going forward.
