 What did I do well this sprint?
I believe I worked through the issues well in this sprint, and set myself a good pace. I was suprised at how well i picked up some concepts. 

 What didn't I do well this sprint?
I think I could have tested out a few more options, and given myself longer before googling for more assistance. this would help me understand what I had done in a beter sense, so once it is correct, I have a better understanding of what was initially wrong. 

 What can I improve on next sprint?
 On the next sprint, I would like to spend more time on the concepts and additional resources. I'd also still like to split up my days more, to have morning and afternoon sessions of study time.
