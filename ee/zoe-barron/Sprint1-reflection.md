What did I do well this sprint?
I think I tried not to ask for help too much, to force myself to struggle a bit more and figure things out for myself.  I made quite a few mistakes, but this was good in the end, because I learnt a lot from them :)
 What didn't I do well this sprint?
 I think I could have used Toggl more efficiently while working, as it was a lot of stop and start in this sprint. 
 What can I improve on next sprint?
 Try to improve the use of toggl, and timeboxing, to avoid going too far downs concept paths.
