 What did I do well this sprint?
I think I did well in this sprint, I'm in terested in going back over some of this material in the lead up to the course starting. 

 What didn't I do well this sprint?
I did lose some motivation where some activites took me a short amount of time, and other were a lot longer, for example the eloquent JS exercises. Some were easier than others which made it feel like I was doing something wrong in the one that took a bit longer, which became frustrating. I've learnt more from those in the end however, which is a good takeaway from it. 

 What can I improve on next sprint?
 Commit to completing certain tasks in the assignment by certain deadlines, rather tha the assignment as a whole. Make it more realistic.
