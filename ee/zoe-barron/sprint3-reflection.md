 What didn't I do well this sprint?
I could have been more focused on the bigger picture first, as I did find i got frustrated at some aspects and would move onto some smaller elements to give myself some time away.

 I could improve my self-discipline, and split up the time used for studying, to make it easier to stick to, ehich will hopefully help me to keep on track.
