 What did I do well this sprint?
I looked a lot into javascript scope, and tried to use all of the different resources to help to form an answer for this. I still think it's hard to write about without having enough practical knowledge, but it's something that will just come with time. 

 What didn't I do well this sprint?
I struggled a lot with the calculator exercise, I had high expectations of myself for this exercise, and was disappointed when I wasn't able to recollect as much as I thought when I starting working on it. I learnt a lot from the exercise though, so hopefully that will help me in future. 

 What can I improve on next sprint?
 Next sprint I think I'll be more motivated to complete as much as possible, as it's the last sprint.
