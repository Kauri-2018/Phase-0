 What did I do well through my nine sprints in Phase 0?
I think I worked through the sprints as best I could, and tried to figure out as much as I could myself, before asking questions, or finding an answer. 

 What could I have done to improve through my nine sprints in Phase 0?
I could have managed my time better, and broken up some activities into smaller pieces to make them more manageable. I think I also could have 
asked for help more in times where I could have reached out to people. 
Ordinarily I would ask a lot of questions, but do struggle in an online environment, to gain the type of trust I would normally need before asking questions. 



 What learnings and habits have I developed that will help me in Bootcamp?
 I've grown my knowledge in all almost everything I've come across. I also have a lot of motivation to build on this in bootcamp. 
 I've learnt to appreciate mistakes I've made, as these help me to learn. 
 Mindfulness has also been very helpful, the 'search inside yourself' book has been bery insightful in terms
 of how to make the most out of your situation, and improve aspects you're not happy with. 
 Keeping track of the time spent on my assignments, or activities in general, has also improved.
