1. What did I do well in this sprint?

I am getting a better handle on basic javascript functions.  I think I understand the higher order functions (filter, map and reduce) and understand how other functions (sort, reverse, split, join, concat) are used.

2. What didn't I do well in this sprint?

I feel like I could have spent a lot more time fully understanding debugging tools.  It is so helpful to understand how we can step through our code and pause it at any stage to see exactly what is going on.  I would like to really made sure I have this sorted come boot camp as this will svae a lot of time.

3. What can I improve on?

I would like to continue to work on the FreeCodeCamp 'Intermediate Algorithm Scripting' to extend my understanding.
