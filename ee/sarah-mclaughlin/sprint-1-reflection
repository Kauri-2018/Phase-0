1. What did I do well in this sprint?
I think I did well to grasp a lot of very new and unfamiliar concepts and technologies and to gain a very basic understanding of commandline, GitHub, HTML and CSS.

2. What didn't I do well in this sprint?
Getting stuck on so many different things!  I'd get blocked on tiny things and therefore the sprint took me ages.

3.What can I improve on?
If I am stuck on something for more than 15 minutes, I should ask for help.
