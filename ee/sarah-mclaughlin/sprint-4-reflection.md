1. What did I do well in this sprint?

I think I did well to work through the majority of the JavaScript exercises without getting stuck or needing to look at the hints.  There were definitely questions/exercises that I will need to revise/reflect on but I understood most of the concepts.

2. What didn't I do well in this sprint?

I still feel a bit overwhelmed by JavaScript and am excited to put the skills learnt into practice so that I have a better understanding of how it fits into the bigger picture.

3. What can I improve on?

I think I could probably spend a bit more time trying to work out an exercise myself before looking at the hints or asking for help.
