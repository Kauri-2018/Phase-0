1. What did I do well in this sprint?
I think I did well to grasp the basics of JavaScript.  There was a lot to take in but I think I am beginning to understand how it all fits together with html and how functions and variables work.

2. What didn't I do well in this sprint?
I feel like I could have spent a lot more time fully understanding the concepts that we touched on in this sprint.  Although I feel like my basic understanding of the concepts is improving I have a lot of work to do in understanding the snytax. 

3. What can I improve on?
I would like to continue to wprk on JavaScript so that I can complete exercises without asking for help or checking the hints.
