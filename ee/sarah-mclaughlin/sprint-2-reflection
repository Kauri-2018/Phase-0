1. What did I do well in this sprint?
I think I did well to grow my understanding of basic html, especially around layout, indentation and the various functions.

2. What didn't I do well in this sprint?
I could always get better at using toggl.  I also feel like I want to go back over my blogs to correct my HTML layout.

3.What can I improve on?
I would like to improve on staying focussed on the sprint I am on.  I sometimes find myself going off on tangents and youtubing CSS tutorials etc just out of interest
when it is not strictly part of the learning in the sprint.
