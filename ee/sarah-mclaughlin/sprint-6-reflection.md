1. What did I do well in this sprint?

I think my understanding of JavaScript developed significantly in this sprint and although I needed help to perfect my functions I was on the right track.  There are still definitely areas that I will need to dveelop/revise/reflect on but I am happy with my progress.

2. What didn't I do well in this sprint?

I still feel a bit overwhelmed by JavaScript and can get frustrated/ovrewhelmed when things don't work and when I feel like I have exhausted all solutions.  However as I am learning more about the console and console.log I am finding alternative ways to find and fix the errors in my code.

3. What can I improve on?

I feel like I probably need to spend a bit of time doing some personal research into how certain aspects of JavaScript work and how it links with the console.  I think ironing out a few areas of confusion would really benefit me before I start on sprint 7.
