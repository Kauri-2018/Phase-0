1. What did I do well in this sprint?
I think I did well to grasp the basics of CSS.  There was a lot to take in and it took a lot of time to experiment with the different functions.

2. What didn't I do well in this sprint?
I feel like I could have spent a lot more time fully understanding the different functions.  There is still so much more to CSS that I don't know about.

3. What can I improve on?
I would like to manage my time better and not let a minor block in CSS put me back multiple hours.
