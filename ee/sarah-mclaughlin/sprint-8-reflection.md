1. What did I do well in this sprint?

I am getting a better handle on how html, css and javascript files all link together in a project.  I did well in this sprint to build a basic calculator.  

2. What didn't I do well in this sprint?

I spent a lot of time on this sprint and I am not convinced my use of time was always productive.  Some days I didn't feel like I achieved much but it was still good learning.

3. What can I improve on?

I would like to continue working on my calculator to remove the 'eval' function and to incorporate an exponent (to the power of) button.
