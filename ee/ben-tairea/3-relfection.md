 What did I do well this sprint?

    I really liked the process of re-designing and re-building the wedsite this week. It was a good chance to learn and new things and really experiment with the code and troubleshooting options. I think I managed to get a pretty good responsive website and I managed to get it somewhat looking like my design. I quickly realised that its alot easier to design than to build.

 What didn't I do well this sprint?

    My timeboxing and time management went out the window with the sprint. My perfection tendencies mean I do struggle moving on or letting something be 'good enough'.

 What can I improve on next sprint?

    Deffinitely timeboxing and being able to let things go. Also staying focused and not trying to learn everything at once.
