What did I do well in this sprint?
    I was more aware of time spent on the differet Javascript lessons so when I couldnt figure out an answer I would recognise when  it was time 'get hint' or google for help.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
    I struggled with trying to understand the logic on some of the answers, hoping to make more sense of javascript in sprint 5

What can I improve on next sprint?
    I tried working closer with my family this week instead of locking myself away in the home office but i quickly realised how easily i get distracted. I will practise meta-attention and try being concious of where my attention and hopefully build a stronger focus on what im doing. If not will hide in my office again.
