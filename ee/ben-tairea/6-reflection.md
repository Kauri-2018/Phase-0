What didnt you do well this sprint?

I really struggled with some of the JS functions. I had misplet a string and it really sent me back and i found it a little bit difficult to really understand what was reqiured to get the checkforwin function to work 

What can I improve on?

Asking for help from the correct source when i was blocked, but I managed to work with someone to figure it out. Took along time. Will have to revisit the minesweeper final touches at a later stage
