What did I do well this Sprint? Staying on track largely for my time commits, I'm glad to be finishing Sprint 5 on Friday/ontime! This week was also a bit of a turning point where I'm starting to reach out more to my cohort members and build more authentic connections. I'm really excited to see where we go!
What didn't I do well on this Sprint? I think it's important I'm gentle on myself, since I'm honestly following through on basically all my time commitments and intentions. However, I did notice that I let slip my focus around Valentine's Day (fancy that). I know that I can't afford to have those kinds of distractions during bootcamp, so I'm taking inventory about that and planning more strategies to maximize my focus.
What can I improve on for the next Sprint? Described above.
