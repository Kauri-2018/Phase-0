This sprint was a bit of a tricky one for me, as I got a bit sit on Wednesday and Thursday. While I did manage to stay on track for completing the Sprint this week, I didn't do the greatest job prioritizing self-care which I paid a price for! It was an important time for me to realize how crucial my self-care regime is, especially as we move into the higher functioning aspect of the JS learning. In future sprints I will be paying closer attention to these different aspects of my health so I can stay focused and give my best to each sprint!
