Sprint 0 has already brought a lot of learning! Something I think I've done well is to get serious about when to google, when (and how) to ask for help, and when to take breaks. I'm sure there'll be lots more to navigate in all of that, ahead. I've learned how important this is since something I didn't do very well was an initial blast to the helpdesk with a super basic question that was my own responsibility to figure out. In terms of learning environments, there's a lot that's new about this style for me! I've also used Sprint 0 to set up some better habits about time management, getting settled in a routine, and setting up better self-care habits like daily meditation and meal planning (well, that second part needs work). I am looking forward to improving the next sprints with more discipline and focus.
