This sprint, I've really practiced utilizing my inner resources to stay grounded. It's been a very difficult week personally due to financial explosiveness with my bank account(s). In terms of things I didn't do well, ... I mean, there is still a lot of room to grow around utility and tool use, but overall I feel like I've done a bang-up job regulating throughout this Sprint. Following through on time management skills (meal prep, committed hours on campus) have helped me loads. For the next sprint, I intend to make sure I stick to my yoga plans! It helped so much when I did it last week and I really missed it this week.
