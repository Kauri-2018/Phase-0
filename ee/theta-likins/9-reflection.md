Relecting on my last 9 Sprints, I feel proud of my own pace, patience, and perserverence. I feel like I'm in good spirits as we approach bootcamp, and I feel a sense of resolve that I haven't let the urge to compare or belittle myself and my abilities/work ethic get too out of hand. I haven't completed a project for Sprint 9 and I'm going to let that be okay. Honestly it's hard to imagine having done a better job within the nine sprints. Not because there aren't ways I can improve my code or more "product" that would've been possible with more time and effort, but my reality is that I have given the best balance of effort and self-caer possible to sustain my experience throughtout Phase-0. I have a much more clear idea about the necessities of self-care and in collaborative/communication driven learning and development through my experience in Phase-0. My habist around mindfulness practice, taking breaks, planning meals, asking for help when I need, and my overall resilience of practice (and self-talk) will undoubtedly serve and further grow me during bootcamp. Bring it on!
