What did I do well this Sprint? Looking back to last Thursday, I sent myself a note on Slack saying "you can do this." A week later, I'm really believing it! This week I've learned about who and how to ask for help, and bit by bit I'm starting to help others! It's a magical feeling, and it's helping me ground so much more in this new part of my life :D Additionally, I am SLAYING at time management this week. A friend helped me design my calendar to reflect the necessary work periods, and my mental health is so much better when I can walk away knowing I put in quite a good day's work! Staying on target for finishing before bootcamp is suddenly WAY more managable and I'm breathing easier (at the moment) while I work my way through :) 
What didn't I do well this Sprint? Apart from wishing I'd started earlier, honestly I think I'm doing pretty great this Sprint. My biggest problem is this ongoing saga of tracking down the problem with CSS. I'm working on it again now with help, and I remain optimistic we'll get it solved :)
What can I improve on for the next Sprint? Since I'm getting time management much more dialed in, and my focus/productivity within those time spans is steadily increasing, I think next week I'll focus on diversifying my lunch menu :P Jokes aside, I've heard that Sprint 3 is a doozy, so I'm pretty sure I'll have my work cut out for me.
