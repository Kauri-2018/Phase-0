Sprint 4 felt like it was going to be notoriously hard. And don't get me wrong, at times it was dizzying! But a little bit of worship to Lord Google helped me find my path (forgive me Harrison, for this is not the last you will hear about the Good Word). I feel glad that I (first was reminded by my peers to go hunting! then,) searched Ye Olde Interwebz for some guidance. Behold! It has been found. Achievement unlocked. Time wise this week, I wasn't perfect, in that I left the final blog posts til Sunday night when I typically try to finish everything by 5pm Friday. Ah well, live and learn. Next week I hope to secure closer BEFORE getting up to my weekend fun, so that little pesty voice isn't in my ear saying "yooou're notttt fiiiiinnniiiiiisssheeed." Alls well that ends well, and Sprint 4 has all in all ended well. :D
