This week has been a tough one, since for about half of it I was battling a pretty nasty stomach bug (and to be totally frank, a bit of a persona life crises that involved a break-up). On the other side of all that, I feel like this Sprint I have come back with more motivation and clarity and commitment to the work. That said, I still don't feel particularly confident in writing the code syntatically. My brain so often draws a blank when trying to start writing. I work so much better from an example, and retain the information more fully that way. With Sprint 8 ahead, I have the intention to bring a really clear and motivated head to the work. I'm going to bring my integrity fully while not beating myself up for needing help. I think I've felt especially taxed in this part of the work because I retain new concepts so much better when I can work with others. I feel confident that bootcamp will really catalyze what I have to offer in this way! It's also important that I give myself credit for doing as much as I can, given life circumstances and my learning styles. It's also important that I stay calm in the present, and motivated towards a future I want. It'll all work out!
