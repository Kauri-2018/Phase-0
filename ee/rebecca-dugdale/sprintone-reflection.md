What did I do well this sprint?
I think I got a handle on most of the concepts for html well this sprint.  I have SO much still to learn, but I think it was valuable for me to spend quite a lot of time before I worked out how to get my assignments mucking around on my own and trying to put together the code to build my web page.  I had to pull resources from a lot of places and do a lot of reading, which was good for me.

 What didn't I do well this sprint?
 Probably managing my time.  I hope that now that I am using toggl I will be able to do that better.

 What can I improve on next sprint?
 Not thinking that I need to get everything done at once, do everything perfectly first time.  This is a work in progress and I have to treat it as such.
