What did I do well through my nine sprints in phase 0?

I think I did well to get some momentum going and get through the sprints fairly quickly. This has been a difficult thing to maintain since January, but I've still managed to work on small projects, not get too frustrated and revise a bit.


What could I have done to improve through these sprints?

I feel I've done as best as I could throughout the sprints, I could have maybe practised pseudocoding a bit more.


What learnings and habits have I developed that will help me in bootcamp?
Apart from the habits I've already had, paircoding/working with others has been great.
