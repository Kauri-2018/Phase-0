What did I do well this sprint?
Talking to Harrison and asking for advice. He made me feel a lot better at the amount I was struggling.

Giving myself permission to take a long time to finish it because motivation was low. I had a lot on with moving countries etc so I think this was a good call.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
This sprint was a real challenge because for some reason I started at the second challenge and skipped the first. I was already feeling unsure of myself because I hadn't been able to do any of the stretch goals in Sprint 6. The first challenge in Sprint 7 taught us everything we needed to know to complete the second. So when I came into the second challenge fresh, I felt completely overwhelmed and confused and found that I didn't know anything and couldn't complete any of the problems. I really stuck at it and tried to do them, but found that I was continually relying on looking at the answers to figure things out. This highlighted for me that I must have an unsecure state of confidence about coding, as my reaction was to feel a bit overwhelemed and helpless. So I talked to Harrison. He reassured me that I was going fine, that Phase 0 was more about showing us what was possible, not expecting us to get it all right away, and that I should just keep going with it. I felt so much better, and when I looked back at the challenges I realised I had missed the one that told us what to do. Once I did that I could do the second challenge with only a regular level of difficulty.

This all affected my motivation so I took a really long time to do this Sprint.

What can I improve on next sprint?
Asking for help sooner
Believing in myself and my abilities when I hit a wall
Pushing forward with it rather than avoiding doing the work.
