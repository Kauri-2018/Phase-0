What did I do well this sprint?
Built a freaken calculator from scratch.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
The calculator could only handle single digit numbers haha. 

But I'm really pleased with the way I approached the problem, I think I've solved it in a different way to anyone else. That's why it doesn't quite work, but points for innovation, I think.

I didn't bother with scheduling up with someone to do pair programming, as I'm runnign out of time. But I think that's okay, I'll save pair programming for bootcamp.

What can I improve on next sprint?
Attend Phase 0 check-ins now that I'm in the right timezone.
