What did I do well this sprint?
I felt really good at the start of the sprint, I got through the first few minesweeper challenges okay.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
I couldn't do the stretch exercises. I couldn't even start. I went back and started going through JavaScript in Codecademy instead to try and figure out what it was i had missed. there must be things I should know but don't. That took too much time so now I'm behind.

What can I improve on next sprint?
Having more time more time more time.
