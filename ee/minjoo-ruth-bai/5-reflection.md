-What did I do well this sprint?
For actually asking help. I tried my best to figure out how jS work but even though I tried hard
I just could not figure out how so as my last option I asked Harrison and it made me feel much 
better. 

-What didn't I do well this sprint?
I guess I don't fully understand Javascript but It seemed to be normal.. I guess I will have to
get used to Javascript.Sometimes I had to look at the answer first so that I could understand how JS
actually works.

-What can I improve on next sprint?
I guess trying not to look at the answers..>??>
