-What did I do well this sprint?
I tried my best to figure out most of the javascript myself. It took me awhile but not longer than the other sprints.

-What didn't I do well this sprint?
For some Javascript I just couldn't seem to get what they wanted me to do so I had to find youtube what they actually meant.
I tried my best though.

-What can I improve on next sprint?
I could possibly work in morning time..? since recently I have been working on sprints from 3-12 so this made me quite tired.
