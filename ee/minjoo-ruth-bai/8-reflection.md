-What did I do well this sprint?
I reached out to other EDA student so we could pair up for js calculator. It was fun to actually figure things out together than doing it alone.The process is much faster

-What didn't I do well this sprint?
The calculator is working but maybe I could have played around with css more (if I had time)

-What can I improve on next sprint? 
Well.. I guess I have many things to improve. My coding skills would get better as I study more but at this point time management.
