What did I do well this sprint?

I think I am more capable of doing self learning than sprint 1. I had minor issues ex text overlapping but I tried to search for it first and try different method before I reach out to people. Asking for help is not bad but by repeating this process I self learn more.

What didn't I do well this sprint?

To be honest before I had no idea of what my website would look like I did not want to start at all. I began with wireframes of the website but it is true that it is hard to build exact same website based on the drawings that you have done. ( Well it is because I need more practice on actually building website based on the design )

What can I improve on next sprint?

Maybe repeating process of coding, testing and refining so I build better looking website. At this point I have basic structure of my website but I would like to refine more so it does not get too repetitive.
