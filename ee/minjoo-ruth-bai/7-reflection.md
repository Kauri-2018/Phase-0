-What did I do well this sprint?
I moved on in a good pace. I was writing notes down as I go.

-What didn't I do well this sprint?
I couldn't put all the notes down and also I had to look at the answer to understand few js structure. 

-What can i improve on next sprint?
Maybe spend more time if I can ( but I am running out of time fast so I might have to come back when I am done with sprints).
