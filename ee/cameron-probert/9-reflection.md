  What did I do well through my nine sprints in Phase 0?
I think I completed the task at hand without getting too bogged down in the details.
Other programming tasks I've done I really spend a lot of time trying to do something
small, just right, which ends up taking away from the project as a whole because
I'm not completing other, important tasks.

  What could I have done to improve through my nine sprints in Phase 0?
I could have interacted with my cohort more, in terms of both weekly check-ins and
on the Slack channel. I also could have spent more time practising meditation.

  What learnings and habits have I developed that will help me in Bootcamp?
I started using the pomodoro timer right from the start of sprint 1, and I've
really enjoyed using it, so I will continue to use that as I go into Bootcamp.
I will also try to think consciously about mindfulness in interactions with myself
and others, to try to develop it into an unconscious skill.
