# Sprint 5 Reflection

## What did I do well this sprint?
I had many a self-hi5 and penny dropping moments in this Sprint.  I did well to ask for help earlier than the previous Sprint (have a read of my blog if you want more juicy details) and I did well to manage my time this Sprint too.
I really like learning JavaScript when I have more real time lessons where I get to apply it like we have with Sprint (YAHOO!).

## What didn't I do so well this sprint?
I haven't been doing my daily meditation practice this last week.  There's no reason why except that I haven't been as diligent as I have been in previous weeks.  I also don't think it's a good idea that my time cue for meditation is before I go to bed.  I'm going to change it to after I wake up, I do 5 minutes of meditation to start my day. 

## What can I improve on next sprint?
The feedback from most of the cohort is Sprint 6 is difficult so I am going to really make use of Time Blocking this next Sprint with a focus on timeblocking to ask for help.  I'll work at an issue for an hour (max) where if I haven't figured it out in that time - I must ask for help.
