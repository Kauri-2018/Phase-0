# Sprint 4 Reflection

## What did I do well this sprint?
I did well to push through and absorb tips and feedback this Sprint.
It also took alot for me to reach out for help.  Me actually asking was a huge personal step forward and on such a public forum like our slack channel. It made the difference for me in this Sprint so self Hi5 and a pat on the back for growing a pair, stepping up and asking for help.

## What didn't I do so well this sprint?
I didn't manage my time well this sprint.  I should have timeblocked for this like I have before and I didn't this time thinking I had lots of time to work through the material but I missed judged just how hard it was going to be.

Also, I need to change my approach to JavaScript.  HTML and CSS were easier to work through and comprehend when I used the process of read, learn, write it down and practice.  It took too long and wasn't necessary because I would forget pretty much the next day.  Lesson - maintain momentum.

## What can I improve on next sprint?
Time and routine is what I need, so make sure I give myself the time and space for study.  I have cut back on my part time hours and no longer working at the bar so this is giving me back precious time and energy.
