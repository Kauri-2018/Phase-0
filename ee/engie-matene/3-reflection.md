# Sprint 3 Reflection

## What did I do well this sprint?
With each task I'm getting better at letting go.
I'm getting better at figuring out desigin techniques through the use of the developer tool in google.  I'm a natural at the code, review, refine technique.  I keep forgetting to validate my html and CSS at the end of each new blog (I may or may not being going back right now and completing this step as we speak - whoops!).

## What didn't I do so well this sprint?
This Sprint is probably my most challenging Sprint yet.  On a personal and technical level.  Personally - realising I am human and with only a certain number of hours in a day realising I need to make time for rest.  Technically, bringing together all that I have learnt so far I had to deal with alot of my own frustration at what I didn't know how to do and not having the time to figure it out.  

It made me have to rethink my approach to this task.  Once I let go of what I didn't know and figure out how to do and look at how and what I can do - well it was like the traffic lights going green.

## What can I improve on next sprint?

1. Take a step back, breath and pulse check moments of frustration to see if there is another way of approaching tasks.
2. I need blocks of time to work on tasks so make sure I free up this time and not over commit with social gatherings.
3. The W3 website has some great learning material.  Plan in 'freetime' to allow me to go through the site and tick off some of the techniques in my wishlist.
