# Sprint 6 Reflection

## What did I do well this sprint?
I did well this Sprint to figure out the layout aspect of Minesweeper pretty quickly.  I didn't do it on my own, I had help from one of my Phase0 crew Zach.  It was with his help that the penny finally dropped and from there the rest of the JS code started to make sense.  

Also, another thing I did well this Sprint is I figured out how I like to debug my JS code.  I used dev tool open on part of my screen and when a block of code wasn't working or it created a blank page (where previously, my minesweeper game was on the screen) I deleted all the new code I created to the point where the game was on the screen again and added a line bit by bit until I found the line with the mistake in it.  Gosh that was a life saver!  It was a good lightbulb moment for me to have figured out this way of debugging.

## What didn't I do so well this sprint?
I have to keep on the look out for the finer details of that I seem to miss quite a bit.  E.g where a space is needed, where brackets is used etc etc.  I had to use dev tool on another Minesweeper to try and figure out how it could be done and then work back from there (it was difficult) but again, because the penny dropped at the beginning it was a good foundation to work from.  

## What can I improve on next sprint?
Next Sprint keep looking for opportunity to write JS code from scratch to build my confidence.  It will also help to build my skill at picking up on the finer details I seem to miss (I can already see it's going to have to be a new habit I need to build when I'm looking at code compared to my mindset when I am reading - I'll explain what I mean by this in my next culturaly blog/technical blog).
