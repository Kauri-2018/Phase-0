# Sprint 7 Reflection

## What did I do well this sprint?
I'm going to say I did well to finish this Sprint with the events I had over the last 3 weeks.  I've finished work in Melbourne, I've packed what I can into 3 large bags and moved back to Wellington.  Resettled at my mum's place in Porirua, found a car, had my partner here for 10 days (he's gone back now) visited my grandfather who isn't well at the moment (our family have been told by the specialists it is a matter of time now.  He can't go off his oxygen machine he will have to be on it for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week) and now my nephew is in hospital with pneumonia.

Sigh - I'm glad I have finished Sprint 7 and will be coming into campus for the rest of this week to complete Sprint 8 and 9.

## What didn't I do so well this sprint?
I didn't manage my time well and I underestimated how long things would actually take and my meditation practice has fallen way off the band wagon.

## What can I improve on next sprint?
Meditation is like exercise, it's during stressful times that I need it the most and yet it is the first thing I stop doing.  I need to remember perfection is not the goal here.  Building a practice is.  Stop, reset and start again.
