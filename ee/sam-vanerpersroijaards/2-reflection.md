What did I do well this sprint?
    - Pretty familiar with Github and getting used to looking up things on the internet when I am lost with something (ie: using keywords and putting them in the right order).

What didn't I do well this sprint?
    - The CSS side of things is still confusing to me but it is quite alot to take
      in all at once and I am hoping that over time it will make more sense (ie: using the selectors correctly and trying to remember which one is which and which one takes precedents over another).

What can I improve on next sprint?
    - Finding the correct work environment (free from distractions). Perhaps I will try coming into the actual campus this coming week.
