 What did I do well this sprint?
    - Using the internet to solve difficult problems that I encountered while learning JS.

 What didn't I do well this sprint?
    - Staying awake reading the chapter for the mindfulness blog. It took me 3 tried to get there in the end haha.

 What can I improve on next sprint?
    - Coming to terms with the harder aspects of Javascript so I can understand them clearly in the future. Currently my understanding of them is ok, but I need to keep refreshing myself so they become concrete in me.
