What didn't I do well this sprint?
    - I found it difficult writing my own javascript for the actual calculator. I read through it and made sure I could understand how each bit of the code was operating.

What can I improve on next sprint?
    - After I have completed Sprint 9, I will go back and try to re-program the js-calc.
