    - Working through the material at a decent rate.

 What didn't I do well this sprint?
    - There were some parts where I would be frustrated with not getting 
    the correct answer and so I would check the internet for it without
    really giving it full attention and implementing some problem solving 
    techniques.

 What can I improve on next sprint?
    - Relaxing and slowly working on problems using techniques I have learnt.
